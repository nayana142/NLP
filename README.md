# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
=================================
* Twitter has become the customers’ favorite platform to express appreciation and resentment. Due to this, brands need to be ultra-proactive in addressing their customers’ queries, positive reviews, or frustration.
* The dataset consists of message, entity, and sentiment in Twitter. There are three classes in the dataset: positive, negative, and neutral. The messages that are not relevant to the entity should be regarded as neutral.
      * Tweet ID: ID of Tweet
      * Entity: Entity that Tweet talks about
      * Sentiment: Sentiment of the tweet text regarding the entity
        Positive, Negative, Neutral, Irrelevant
      * Tweet Content: Tweet Text
# Data Sentiment Analysis
  =========================
  
    1.Import data
    2.Data Preprocessing:
    Clean the text data by removing special characters, punctuation, and irrelevant information like URLs or HTML tags. Normalize the text by converting all letters to lowercase and handling issues like contractions or abbreviations.
    3.Tokenization:
    Break the text into smaller units, typically words or subwords. This step converts the text into tokens that can be processed further.
    4.Stopwords Removal:
    Eliminate common words like "and," "the," or "is" that don't carry significant sentiment information. These words are known as stopwords and can be excluded from the analysis.
    5.Feature Extraction:
    Convert the tokens into numerical features that machine learning models can understand. Common techniques include using word embeddings like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)or Embedding layer.
    Sentiment Classification:
    Train a machine learning model (such as logistic regression, recurrent neural networks LSTM) using labeled data (where sentiments are known) to predict the sentiment of unseen text.
    The model learns from the features extracted from the text and associated sentiments to classify new text into positive, negative, or neutral categories.
    Model Evaluation:
            Assess the performance of the sentiment analysis model using evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or confusion matrix to gauge its effectiveness in predicting sentiments correctly.
